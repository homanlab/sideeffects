  abstract = {Second-generation antipsychotics have demonstrated efficacy for patients with schizophrenia but are associated with wide-ranging side effects. Brexpiprazole, a serotonin-dopamine activity modulator, has demonstrated efficacy in adult patients with schizophrenia. This paper provides an overview of the safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole in patients with schizophrenia through examination of pooled safety data from one Phase 2 and two Phase 3 6-week, short-term studies, and two open-label, 52-week, long-term studies. In the short-term studies, there were no reports of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with an incidence≥5\% and twice that of placebo in patients treated with brexpiprazole 2-4mg. In the long-term studies, TEAEs reported by ≥5\% of patients were schizophrenia (10.7\%), insomnia (8.0\%), weight increase (7.7\%), headache (6.0\%), and agitation (5.2\%). Akathisia rates were low in the short- (5.8\%, pooled brexpiprazole group) and long-term studies (4.6\%). Sedation rates were low in the short- (2.3\%, pooled brexpiprazole group) and long-term studies (0.9\%). Mean body weight increase was 1.1kg in both short- and long-term studies. For all studies, changes from baseline to last visit in laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram values, and vital signs were small and not clinically relevant. Changes in lipid profiles or other metabolic parameters were also small. Collectively, these studies suggest that brexpiprazole was well tolerated, with a favorable safety profile that does not exhibit significant rates of important adverse events that can be seen with existing antipsychotics (akathisia, sedation, weight gain, or QTc prolongation), and therefore may provide a useful treatment option for patients with schizophrenia.

  abstract   = {Importance: An assumption among clinicians and researchers is that patients with schizophrenia vary considerably in their response to antipsychotic drugs in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
Objective: To evaluate the overall variation in individual treatment response from random variation by comparing the variability between treatment and control groups.
Data Sources: Cochrane Schizophrenia, MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, BIOSIS Previews, ClinicalTrials.gov, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from January 1, 1955, to December 31, 2016.
Study Selection: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCTs of adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and prescription for licensed antipsychotic drugs.
Data Extraction and Synthesis: Means and SDs of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale pretreatment and posttreatment outcome difference scores were extracted. Data quality and validity were ensured by following the PRISMA guidelines.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome measure was the overall variability ratio of treatment to control in a meta-analysis across RCTs. Individual variability ratios were weighted by the inverse-variance method and entered into a random-effects model. A personal element of response was hypothesized to be reflected by a substantial overall increase in variability in the treatment group compared with the control group.
Results: An RCT was simulated, comprising 30 patients with schizophrenia randomized to either the treatment or the control group. The different components of variation in RCTs were illustrated with simulated data. In addition, we assessed the variability ratio in 52 RCTs involving 15 360 patients with a schizophrenia or schizoaffective diagnosis. The variability was slightly lower in the treatment compared with the control group (variability ratio = 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.95-0.99; P = .01).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, no evidence was found in RCTs that antipsychotic drugs increased the outcome variance, suggesting no personal element of response to treatment but instead indicating that the variance was slightly lower in the treatment group than in the control group; although the study cannot rule out that subsets of patients respond differently to treatment, it suggests that the average treatment effect is a reasonable assumption for the individual patient.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: The question of which antipsychotic drug should be preferred for the treatment of schizophrenia is controversial, and conventional pairwise meta-analyses cannot provide a hierarchy based on the randomised evidence. We aimed to integrate the available evidence to create hierarchies of the comparative efficacy, risk of all-cause discontinuation, and major side-effects of antipsychotic drugs.
METHODS: We did a Bayesian-framework, multiple-treatments meta-analysis (which uses both direct and indirect comparisons) of randomised controlled trials to compare 15 antipsychotic drugs and placebo in the acute treatment of schizophrenia. We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for reports published up to Sept 1, 2012. Search results were supplemented by reports from the US Food and Drug Administration website and by data requested from pharmaceutical companies. Blinded, randomised controlled trials of patients with schizophrenia or related disorders were eligible. We excluded trials done in patients with predominant negative symptoms, concomitant medical illness, or treatment resistance, and those done in stable patients. Data for seven outcomes were independently extracted by two reviewers. The primary outcome was efficacy, as measured by mean overall change in symptoms. We also examined all-cause discontinuation, weight gain, extrapyramidal side-effects, prolactin increase, QTc prolongation, and sedation.
FINDINGS: We identified 212 suitable trials, with data for 43 049 participants. All drugs were significantly more effective than placebo. The standardised mean differences with 95\% credible intervals were: clozapine 0·88, 0·73-1·03; amisulpride 0·66, 0·53-0·78; olanzapine 0·59, 0·53-0·65; risperidone 0·56, 0·50-0·63; paliperidone 0·50, 0·39-0·60; zotepine 0·49, 0·31-0·66; haloperidol 0·45, 0·39-0·51; quetiapine 0·44, 0·35-0·52; aripiprazole 0·43, 0·34-0·52; sertindole 0·39, 0·26-0·52; ziprasidone 0·39, 0·30-0·49; chlorpromazine 0·38, 0·23-0·54; asenapine 0·38, 0·25-0·51; lurasidone 0·33, 0·21-0·45; and iloperidone 0·33, 0·22-0·43. Odds ratios compared with placebo for all-cause discontinuation ranged from 0·43 for the best drug (amisulpride) to 0·80 for the worst drug (haloperidol); for extrapyramidal side-effects 0·30 (clozapine) to 4·76 (haloperidol); and for sedation 1·42 (amisulpride) to 8·82 (clozapine). Standardised mean differences compared with placebo for weight gain varied from -0·09 for the best drug (haloperidol) to -0·74 for the worst drug (olanzapine), for prolactin increase 0·22 (aripiprazole) to -1·30 (paliperidone), and for QTc prolongation 0·10 (lurasidone) to -0·90 (sertindole). Efficacy outcomes did not change substantially after removal of placebo or haloperidol groups, or when dose, percentage of withdrawals, extent of blinding, pharmaceutical industry sponsorship, study duration, chronicity, and year of publication were accounted for in meta-regressions and sensitivity analyses.
INTERPRETATION: Antipsychotics differed substantially in side-effects, and small but robust differences were seen in efficacy. Our findings challenge the straightforward classification of antipsychotics into first-generation and second-generation groupings. Rather, hierarchies in the different domains should help clinicians to adapt the choice of antipsychotic drug to the needs of individual patients. These findings should be considered by mental health policy makers and in the revision of clinical practice guidelines.
FUNDING: None.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic response after the initiation of neuroleptic treatment shows wide variation in schizophrenic patient populations. In this overview, the authors suggest that the variance in antipsychotic drug response within schizophrenia can be reduced by resolving the schizophrenias into several discrete "endophenotypes," each with different etiologic underpinnings.
METHOD: Studies relating differences in the relative speed or completeness of antipsychotic response to differences in distribution of 2 biological markers with possible etiologic significance are reviewed. Such studies had assessed recently hospitalized, neuroleptic-free patients undergoing exacerbation of nonaffective psychotic disorders. Prior to initiation of neuroleptic, the cohort of patients had been assessed for the quantity of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid in plasma (pHVA) and had undergone the first of 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies for analyses of ventricle volumes. A second MRI was subsequently performed during a period of (partial) remission to determine within-patient stability of ventricular volumes. These selected studies assessed the distribution of pHVA and distribution of rates of ventricular change, with non-normal distributions resolved by K-means clustering. The speed and completeness of neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic response were related to 3 clusters of patients delineated by modal distributions of pHVA and of apparent rates of ventricular change.
RESULTS: At least 3 unique "endophenotypes" of the "group of the schizophrenias" can be defined with respect to speed and completeness of antipsychotic response. Each endophenotype appears to show at least one unique biological feature that differentiates it from a normal comparison group. A rapidly responsive psychosis was associated with excessive production of dopamine, as identifiable by elevation of pHVA and a "good-prognosis" course. A delayed-response psychosis had low-to-normal pHVA, clinically demonstrated persistent negative symptoms, and was associated with an excessive rate of change in ventricle volume between exacerbations of psychosis and (partial) remissions. Finally, a nonresponsive psychosis could be characterized as having both low-to-normal pHVA and rate of change of ventricle volumes similar to that of controls. Additional studies revealed that each of the endophenotypes had high rates of the psychoses in family members. The good-prognosis course of the rapidly responsive group of studied patients was also found in their family members who had psychotic disorders. Similarly, the prominent negative symptoms of the delayed-response probands were reflected as a prominent trait in their family members also afflicted with psychosis. The endophenotypes tended to "breed true" in terms of prognosis and negative symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Major differences in antipsychotic response patterns appear to be associated with patient and family characteristics that may be related to differences in the etiology and consequent pathophysiology of illness.},

  abstract = {Adherence to antipsychotics improves outcome in schizophrenia. There is a lack of consensus on which factors most influence adherence behaviour and methodological issues hinder interpretation of existing evidence. A rigorous systematic search designed to identify robustly implicated factors emerging from methodologically rigorous studies narrowed our search to 13 observational studies (total N=6235) relating to adherence, antipsychotics and schizophrenia. Studies varied significantly, with reported adherence rates ranging from 47.2\% to 95\%. Positive attitude to medication and illness insight were the only factors consistently associated with better adherence, while contradictory results were found for socio-demographic characteristics, symptom severity and side effects. Only distinct aspects of the therapeutic relationship and social support in younger patients were related to good adherence. Antipsychotic type or formulation and neurocognitive functioning did not appear to impact medication adherence. Despite greater methodological rigour in determining studies to include in the present systematic review, it remains difficult to guide clinicians in this vital area and most of the work discussed contained small sample sizes. Future research in this field should therefore prioritise prospective study designs over longer periods and larger samples in naturalistic settings, providing a more appropriate and clinically meaningful framework than widely used cross-sectional designs.},

Some concern the practical realities of clinical research on patients. Others are to do with the value and purpose of balance. Still others are to do with a confusion about the role of conditioning in valid statistical inference. I consider a simple game of chance involving two dice to illustrate some points about inference and then consider the seven misunderstandings in turn. I conclude that although one should not make a fetish of randomisation, when proposing alternatives to randomisation in clinical trials, one should be very careful to be precise about the exact nature of the alternative being considered if one is to avoid the danger of underestimating the advantages that randomisation can offer.

Methods. – The 213 schizophrenics, treated with conventional antipsychotics, were recruited in two psychiatric hospitals in Hamburg. Subjects were assessed about type and severity of present and past side effects and their attitude and adherence to antipsychotic treatment. Results. – The 82 (39\%) patients presented present SE while 131 (61\%) did not. Sexual dysfunctions (P {\textless} 0.001), extrapyramidal (P {\textless} 0.05) and psychic side effects (P {\textless} 0.05) were rated as significantly subjectively more distressing than sedation or vegetative side effects. Patients presenting with present SE compared with patients without present SE had a significantly more negative general attitude toward antipsychotics (P {\textless} 0.05), were more doubtful about their efficacy (P {\textless} 0.01) and were less likely to encourage a relative to take such a medication in case of need (P {\textless} 0.001). A regression analysis indicated that nonadherence was mainly influenced by negative general and efficacy attitudes toward antipsychotics and the experience of past or present antipsychotic side effects. Conclusions. – All antipsychotic side effects, present or past, can have a durable negative impact on patient's attitude toward antipsychotic treatment and adherence. Non-adherence is mainly determined, among other factors, by these negative attitudes, which are partly influenced by the experience of past or present antipsychotic-induced side effects.},

  abstract = {Antipsychotics are crucial for the treatment of schizophrenia and contribute to weight gain in psychosis, particularly during early phases. Antipsychotic Induced Weight Gain (AIWG) might contribute to reduce the quality of life, drug compliance and to increase mortality. To characterize sex differences of gene expression related to AIWG, we sequenced total mRNA from blood samples of schizophrenia patients, before and after 3 months of antipsychotic-treatment. We analyzed schizophrenia patients according to their sex (38 males and 39 females) and their BMI increase after medication, characterizing the differential gene expression before and after medication. Individuals in each group were categorized in patients who gain weight and those whose do not gain weight. The "weight gain" groups included patients with an increase of body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater} 1.0 points (27 males and 23 females with a median BMI increase of 2.68 and 2.32 respectively). The "no weight gain" groups included patients with a change of BMI between {\textless} 1.0 and {\textgreater} -1.0 points (11 males and 16 females with a median BMI increase of 0.21 and 0.16 respectively). The males had 331 genes with significant differential expression in the weight gain group and 24 genes in the no weight gain group. The females had 119 genes with significant differential expression in the weight gain group and 75 genes in the no weight gain group. Both weight gain groups were significantly enriched with "obesity" genes (Fisher; p = 1.1E-09 and p = 0.0001 respectively), according to the Gene Reference into Function (GeneRIF) database.In conclusion, we characterized genes with differential expression associated to AIWG that are specific to males, to females and common to both sexes. These genes are good candidates to depict the biological processes involved in AIWG and provide additional evidence of the genetic links between weight gain and the immune system.},

  abstract   = {Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges’ d or the response ratio. However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.},

  abstract   = {Importance: Schizophrenia is associated with alterations in mean regional brain volumes. However, it is not known whether the clinical heterogeneity seen in the disorder is reflected at the neurobiological level, for example, in differences in the interindividual variability of these brain volumes relative to control individuals.
Objective: To investigate whether patients with first-episode schizophrenia exhibit greater variability of regional brain volumes in addition to mean volume differences.
Data Sources: Studies that reported regional brain volumetric measures in patients and controls by using magnetic resonance imaging in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases from inception to October 1, 2016, were examined.
Study Selection: Case-control studies that reported regional brain volumes in patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls by using magnetic resonance imaging were selected.
Data Extraction and Synthesis: Means and variances (SDs) were extracted for each measure to calculate effect sizes, which were combined using multivariate meta-analysis.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Relative variability of regional brain volumetric measurements in patients compared with control groups as indexed by the variability ratio (VR) and coefficient of variation ratio (CVR). Hedges g was used to quantify mean differences.
Results: A total of 108 studies that reported measurements from 3901 patients (1272 [32.6\%] female) with first-episode schizophrenia and 4040 controls (1613 [39.9\%] female) were included in the analyses. Variability of putamen (VR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.24; P = .01), temporal lobe (VR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.21; P = .004), thalamus (VR, 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.26; P {\textless} .001), and third ventricle (VR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.20-1.71; P {\textless} 1 × 10-5) volume was significantly greater in patients, whereas variability of anterior cingulate cortex volume was lower (VR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.81-0.98; P = .02). These findings were robust to choice of outcome measure. There was no evidence of altered variability of caudate nucleus or frontal lobe volumes. Mean volumes of the lateral (g = 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.29-0.51; P {\textless} .001) and third ventricles (g = 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.59; P {\textless} .001) were greater, whereas mean volumes of the amygdala (g = -0.46; -0.65 to -0.26; P {\textless} .001), anterior cingulate cortex (g = -0.26; 95\% CI, -0.43 to -0.10; P = .005), frontal lobe (g = -0.31; 95\% CI, -0.44 to -0.19; P = .001), hippocampus (g = -0.66; 95\% CI, -0.84 to -0.47; P {\textless} .001), temporal lobe (g = -0.22; 95\% CI, -0.36 to -0.09; P = .001), and thalamus (g = -0.36; 95\% CI, -0.57 to -0.15; P = .001) were lower in patients. There was no evidence of altered mean volume of caudate nucleus or putamen.
Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to altered mean volume of many brain structures, schizophrenia is associated with significantly greater variability of temporal cortex, thalamus, putamen, and third ventricle volumes, consistent with biological heterogeneity in these regions, but lower variability of anterior cingulate cortex volume. This finding indicates greater homogeneity of anterior cingulate volume and, considered with the significantly lower mean volume of this region, suggests that this is a core region affected by the disorder.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis therefore focus on the use of clozapine as first-line or second-line treatment in non-treatment-resistant patients. Methods Articles were eligible if they investigated clozapine compared to another antipsychotic as a first- or second-line treatment in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SCZ) patients and provided data on treatment response. We performed random-effects meta-analyses. Results Fifteen articles were eligible for the systematic review (N = 314 subjects on clozapine and N = 800 on other antipsychotics). Our meta-analysis comparing clozapine to a miscellaneous group of antipsychotics revealed a significant benefit of clozapine (Hedges’ g = 0.220, P = 0.026, 95\% CI = 0.026–0.414), with no evidence of heterogeneity. In addition, a sensitivity analysis revealed a significant benefit of clozapine over risperidone (Hedges’ g = 0.274, P = 0.030, 95\% CI = 0.027–0.521). Conclusion The few eligible trials on this topic suggest that clozapine may be more effective than other antipsychotics when used as first- or second-line treatment. Only large clinical trials may comprehensively probe disease stage-dependent superiority of clozapine and investigate overall tolerability.},

Over decades, there have been numerous research studies evaluating health interventions and policy efforts aimed at improving adherence, yet no universal or consistently high impact solutions have been identified. At present, new challenges and opportunities in policy and the movement toward value-based care should foster an environment that appreciates adherence as a mechanism to improve health outcomes and control costs (eg, fewer hospitalizations, reduced health care utilization). Our objective was to provide a commentary on recent changes in the landscape of research and health policy directed toward improving adherence and an actionable agenda to achieve system level savings and improved health by harnessing the benefits of medications. Specifically, we address the complementary perspectives of precision medicine and population health management; integrating data sources to develop innovative measurement of adherence and target adherence interventions; and behavioral economics to determine appropriate incentives.

  abstract   = {Hyperprolactinemia is increasingly studied as a frequent and potentially important consequence of antipsychotic medication treatment. Some individuals presenting with hyperprolactinemia remain asymptomatic, but others may exhibit a wide range of clinical symptoms resulting from either the direct effects of prolactin on body tissues (galactorrhea, gynecomastia) or endocrine-related secondary effects (sexual and reproductive dysfunction in the short term, and possibly the risk of tumorigenesis and osteoporosis in the longer term). Short-term side effects may negatively impact medication compliance, and long-term effects have the potential for serious health consequences. Antipsychotic medications have differing propensities to cause prolactin elevation. The first-generation antipsychotics, as well as the second-generation antipsychotic risperidone and its active metabolite paliperidone, have been shown to cause marked and sustained elevations in prolactin levels, whereas others of the second-generation antipsychotics appear to have little or no effect on prolactin levels or may decrease prolactin. A comprehensive overview of antipsychotics and hyperprolactinemia is presented together with a review of emerging evidence about the short- and long-term health risks of hyperprolactinemia.},

  abstract = {Dopamine is a small and relatively simple molecule that fulfills diverse functions. Within the brain, it acts as a classical neurotransmitter whose attenuation or overactivity can result in disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Major advances in the cloning and characterization of biosynthetic enzymes, transporters, and receptors have increased our knowledge regarding the metabolism, release, reuptake, and mechanism of action of dopamine. Dopamine reaches the pituitary via hypophysial portal blood from several hypothalamic nerve tracts that are regulated by PRL itself, estrogens, and several neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. Dopamine binds to type-2 dopamine receptors that are functionally linked to membrane channels and G proteins and suppresses the high intrinsic secretory activity of the pituitary lactotrophs. In addition to inhibiting PRL release by controlling calcium fluxes, dopamine activates several interacting intracellular signaling pathways and suppresses PRL gene expression and lactotroph proliferation. Thus, PRL homeostasis should be viewed in the context of a fine balance between the action of dopamine as an inhibitor and the many hypothalamic, systemic, and local factors acting as stimulators, none of which has yet emerged as a primary PRL releasing factor. The generation of transgenic animals with overexpressed or mutated genes expanded our understanding of dopamine-PRL interactions and the physiological consequences of their perturbations. PRL release in humans, which differs in many respects from that in laboratory animals, is affected by several drugs used in clinical practice. Hyperprolactinemia is a major neuroendocrine-related cause of reproductive disturbances in both men and women. The treatment of hyperprolactinemia has greatly benefited from the generation of progressively more effective and selective dopaminergic drugs.},

  abstract   = {Since the 1970s, clinicians have increasingly become more familiar with hyperprolactinemia (HPRL) as a common adverse effect of antipsychotic medication, which remains the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment for patients with schizophrenia. Although treatment with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) as a group is, compared with use of the first-generation antipsychotics, associated with lower prolactin (PRL) plasma levels, the detailed effects on plasma PRL levels for each of these compounds in reports often remain incomplete or inaccurate. Moreover, at this moment, no review has been published about the effect of the newly approved antipsychotics asenapine, iloperidone and lurasidone on PRL levels. The objective of this review is to describe PRL physiology; PRL measurement; diagnosis, causes, consequences and mechanisms of HPRL; incidence figures of (new-onset) HPRL with SGAs and newly approved antipsychotics in adolescent and adult patients; and revisit lingering questions regarding this hormone. A literature search, using the MEDLINE database (1966–December 2013), was conducted to identify relevant publications to report on the state of the art of HPRL and to summarize the available evidence with respect to the propensity of the SGAs and the newly approved antipsychotics to elevate PRL levels. Our review shows that although HPRL usually is defined as a sustained level of PRL above the laboratory upper limit of normal, limit values show some degree of variability in clinical reports, making the interpretation and comparison of data across studies difficult. Moreover, many reports do not provide much or any data detailing the measurement of PRL. Although the highest rates of HPRL are consistently reported in association with amisulpride, risperidone and paliperidone, while aripiprazole and quetiapine have the most favorable profile with respect to this outcome, all SGAs can induce PRL elevations, especially at the beginning of treatment, and have the potential to cause new-onset HPRL. Considering the PRL-elevating propensity of the newly approved antipsychotics, evidence seems to indicate these agents have a PRL profile comparable to that of clozapine (asenapine and iloperidone), ziprasidone and olanzapine (lurasidone). PRL elevations with antipsychotic medication generally are dose dependant. However, antipsychotics having a high potential for PRL elevation (amisulpride, risperidone and paliperidone) can have a profound impact on PRL levels even at relatively low doses, while PRL levels with antipsychotics having a minimal effect on PRL, in most cases, can remain unchanged (quetiapine) or reduce (aripiprazole) over all dosages. Although tolerance and decreases in PRL values after long-term administration of PRL-elevating antipsychotics can occur, the elevations, in most cases, remain above the upper limit of normal. PRL profiles of antipsychotics in children and adolescents seem to be the same as in adults. The hyperprolactinemic effects of antipsychotic medication are mostly correlated with their affinity for dopamine D2 receptors at the level of the anterior pituitary lactotrophs (and probably other neurotransmitter mechanisms) and their blood–brain barrier penetrating capability. Even though antipsychotics are the most common cause of pharmacologically induced HPRL, recent research has shown that HPRL can be pre-existing in a substantial portion of antipsychotic-naïve patients with first-episode psychosis or at-risk mental state.},

  abstract = {Antipsychotics are the most common cause of pharmacologically induced hyperprolactinemia. Although this adverse effect was the subject of numerous observations, the mechanisms and promotive factors were not completely investigated yet. Increased awareness of clinical consequences of hyperprolactinemia implicates the necessity for further examinations. The aim of this randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled study was to do a systematic examination of the effects of different antidopaminergic mechanisms on prolactin secretion in healthy volunteers. A 7-day intervention was performed with aripiprazole, haloperidol, or reserpine. Prolactin levels changed significantly in the haloperidol (from 177.2 ± 74.6 to 350.7 ± 202.6 mU/L; P {\textless} 0.0001) and in the reserpine groups (from 149.6 ± 80.2 to 540.3 ± 280.8 mU/L; P {\textless} 0.0001) but not after aripiprazole (from 160.9 ± 65.0 to 189.6 ± 209.6 mU/L; P = 0.69) or placebo (from 211.6 ± 113.4 mU/L to 196.1 ± 85.6 mU/L; P = 0.8). After haloperidol and reserpine, increases in prolactin were significantly more pronounced in women than in men. Furthermore, in women using hormonal contraception, the increase in prolactin was significantly greater than in those without additional estrogen supply. These results demonstrate that the effect of antipsychotic drugs on prolactin levels strongly depends on their mechanism of action. Reserpine, a vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 blocker, causes the most distinct increase. This implies that D₂ receptor blockade on the lactotrophs is not the sole major cause leading to hyperprolactinemia. The partial agonistic effect of aripiprazole was sufficient to maintain prolactin on physiologic levels. The strong influences of sex and hormonal contraception underline the sensitizing effect of estrogens to the antipsychotic-induced prolactin increase.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychiatric medications are widely prescribed in the USA. Many antipsychotics cause serum hyperprolactinemia as an adverse side effect; prolactin-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling both induces cell differentiation and suppresses apoptosis. It is controversial whether these antipsychotics increase breast cancer risk.
METHODS: We investigated the impact of several antipsychotics on mammary tumorigenesis initiated by retrovirus-mediated delivery of either ErbB2 or HRas or by transgenic expression of Wnt-1.
RESULTS: We found that the two hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics, risperidone and pimozide, prompted precancerous lesions to progress to cancer while aripiprazole, which did not cause hyperprolactinemia, did not. We observed that risperidone and pimozide (but not aripiprazole) caused precancerous cells to activate STAT5 and suppress apoptosis while exerting no impact on proliferation. Importantly, we demonstrated that these effects of antipsychotics on early lesions required the STAT5 gene function. Furthermore, we showed that only two-week treatment of mice with ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, blocked STAT5 activation, restored apoptosis, and prevented early lesion progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics instigate precancerous cells to progress to cancer via JAK/STAT5 to suppress the apoptosis anticancer barrier, and these cancer-promoting effects can be prevented by prophylactic anti-JAK/STAT5 treatment. This preclinical work exposes a potential breast cancer risk from hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics in certain patients and suggests a chemoprevention regime that is relatively easy to implement compared to the standard 5-year anti-estrogenic treatment in women who have or likely have already developed precancerous lesions while also requiring hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics.},

METHODS: We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of psychotropic medication use (any, typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, and lithium) with invasive and in situ breast cancer risk among Women's Health Initiative participants (N = 155,737).
RESULTS: Prevalence of psychotropic medication use was low (n = 642; 0.4\%). During an average 14.8 (SD, 6.5) years of follow-up, 10,067 invasive and 2,285 in situ breast tissues were diagnosed. Any psychotropic medication use was not associated with invasive breast cancer risk compared with nonusers (HR, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.57-1.18). In situ breast cancer risk was higher among "typical" antipsychotic medication users compared with nonusers (HR, 2.05; 95\% CI, 0.97-4.30).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support an association of psychotropic medication use with invasive breast cancer risk. The possible elevation in in situ breast cancer risk associated with "typical" antipsychotics could not be explained by differences in screening mammography utilization and merits further study.
IMPACT: Our findings contribute to knowledge of the safety profile of psychotropic medications and may be useful to clinicians and patients considering use of these medications.},

  abstract   = {Hyperprolactinaemia is a common adverse event reported in association with treatments used in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Recent data are suggestive that hyperprolactinaemia may have a range of significant short-and long-term clinical consequences. The objective of this review is to examine the causes, frequency and clinical consequences of hyperprolactinaemia in the severely mentally ill (SMI) with a focus on patients taking antipsychotic medications. A Medline search was carried out to identify relevant publications. Reference lists from previous review articles were also examined to search for additional data. Hyperprolactinaemia may be one of the most common adverse events associated with some antipsychotic medications. Precise rates with individual drugs had however until recently been poorly categorized. The relationship between hyperprolactinaemia and adverse outcomes in the SMI population appears similar to that in the general population. Adverse outcomes (such as sexual dysfunction) can occur acutely and in the longer term (bone fractures and possibly breast cancer), but the precise link between degree and length of hyperprolactinaemia and adverse outcome remains to be established. In conclusion, hyperprolactinaemia is a common treatment-emergent adverse event of some antipsychotic medications and may have clinical consequences. Physicians must balance the benefits and risks of treatment when determining appropriate therapy for individual patients.},

  abstract   = {Background:Follow-up studies of weight gain related to antipsychotic treatment beyond a year are limited in number. We compared weight change in the three most commonly prescribed antipsychotics in a representative UK General Practice database.Method:We conducted a cohort study in United Kingdom primary care records of people newly prescribed olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone. The primary outcome was weight in each six month period for two years after treatment initiation. Weight changes were compared using linear regression, adjusted for age, baseline weight and diagnosis.Results:N = 6338 people received olanzapine, 12,984 quetiapine and 6556 risperidone. Baseline weight was lowest for men treated with olanzapine (80.8 kg versus 83.5 kg quetiapine, 82.0 kg risperidone) and women treated with olanzapine (67.7 kg versus 71.5 kg quetiapine 68.4 kg risperidone. Weight gain occurred during treatment with all three drugs. Compared with risperidone mean weight gain was higher with olanzapine (adjusted co-efficient +1.24 kg (95\% confidence interval: 0.69?1.79 kg per six months) for men and +0.77 kg (95\% confidence interval: 0.29?1.24 kg) for women). Weight gain with quetiapine was lower in unadjusted models compared with risperidone, but this difference was not significant after adjustment.Conclusion:Olanzapine is more commonly prescribed to people with lower weight. However, after accounting for baseline weight, age, sex and diagnosis, olanzapine is still associated with greater weight gain over two years than risperidone or quetiapine. Baseline weight does not ameliorate the risks of weight gain associated with antipsychotic medication. Weight gain should be assertively discussed and managed for people prescribed antipsychotics, especially olanzapine.},

To explore the impact of premorbid and baseline body mass indices (BMIs) as well as BMI of patient’s parents and associated variables on the prediction of antipsychotic-induced body weight gain.
Methods
Retrospective/cross-sectional data of 65 patients receiving clozapine, olanzapine and/or risperidone were assessed according to a systematic categorization of the long-term (7.3±9.2 years) weight course and evaluated using descriptive, explorative correlation and regression analyses.
Results
Increased values of parents’ BMI (p=0.041) and patients’ BMI at premorbid stage (p=0.039) and prior to first antipsychotic treatment (p=0.032) as well as female gender (p=0.012), younger age (p=0.005) and non-smoking (p=0.047) have the most predictive value on body weight gain under antipsychotic treatment including pre-treatment with typical antipsychotics. Weight gain under atypical antipsychotics (pre-treatment excluded) is predicted by an increased premorbid BMI (p=0.019). Conversely, a low BMI prior to first antipsychotic treatment predicts a higher acceleration of BMI change (p=0.008) in vulnerable individuals, but not total BMI change itself. Furthermore, a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder showed a trend towards the prediction of an increased atypical ΔBMI (p=0.067), possibly due to a longer treatment duration with atypical antipsychotics (p{\textless}0.001).
Discussion
The study indicates increased parents’ BMI and patients’ premorbid BMI, female gender, younger age and – as a trend – the diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder to be predictors for antipsychotic-induced body weight gain involving atypical antipsychotics. Data contribute to the assumption of a strong impact of predispositional factors on weight gain, besides treatment-related factors.},

Results The group that received add-on treatment with antipsychotics neither gained more weight nor were at higher risk for a clinically significant weight gain than the reference group. Instead, factors associated with clinically significant weight gain were female sex, young age, low-baseline BMI, and occurrence of manic/hypomanic episodes.

This study investigates the efficacy and safety of AZD8529, a selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) at the mGlu2 receptor, in symptomatic patients with schizophrenia.
METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive AZD8529 40 mg, risperidone 4 mg, or placebo as monotherapy. Treatment lasted for 28 days, and clinical efficacy was assessed using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between patients treated with AZD8529 versus placebo in change from baseline to endpoint in PANSS total, negative and positive symptom subscale, or CGI-S scores. In contrast, risperidone demonstrated significant efficacy relative to placebo.
CONCLUSION: These results do not support a role for the mGluR-2 PAM AZD8529 as an antipsychotic and indicate that positive modulation of mGluR type 2 receptors alone is not sufficient for antipsychotic effects in acutely ill schizophrenia patients.},

Paliperidone (9-OH-risperidone, metabolite of risperidone), when used with OROS technology has a unique pharmacokinetic profile undergoing limited hepatic metabolism.
METHODS: The efficacy and safety of once-daily paliperidone ER (3 mg, 9 mg and 15 mg) were compared with placebo in 618 patients with acute schizophrenia in a 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. An assay sensitivity group with known efficacy was included to confirm trial validity (olanzapine 10 mg).
RESULTS: All doses of paliperidone ER demonstrated significant improvements in PANSS total and PANSS factors scores (p{\textless}0.05) and in personal and social functioning (p{\textless}0.001) compared with placebo. Symptom improvement has been observed at the first observation assessment (Day 4) (p{\textless}0.001) compared with placebo, suggesting a rapid onset of action for paliperidone ER. Paliperidone ER was associated with a low incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. The incidence of movement disorder-related adverse events and rating scale scores were similar in the paliperidone ER 3 mg and placebo groups and increased with dose. Increases in prolactin plasma levels and dose-related increases in body weight ({\textless}2 kg) were observed; there were no significant changes in serum lipid or glucose levels.
CONCLUSION: In this study, all doses of paliperidone ER were effective in significantly improving the symptoms of schizophrenia and personal and social functioning and were generally well tolerated. As such, paliperidone ER may provide a valuable new treatment option for patients with schizophrenia.},

  abstract   = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) in a 6-week, double-blind, randomized study.
METHOD: Patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of acute schizophrenia were randomly assigned to fixed-dose quetiapine XR 400, 600, or 800 mg/day (once daily in the evening), quetiapine immediate release (IR) 400 mg/day (200 mg twice daily), or placebo. Dual-matched placebo was used to maintain blinding. Quetiapine XR target doses were reached by day 2 (400 and 600 mg) and day 3 (800 mg). The primary endpoint was least squares mean change from baseline to week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score. PANSS response rate (percentage of patients with {\textgreater} or = 30\% reduction in total score), Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I) response rate (percentage of patients with score {\textless} or = 3), change in CGI-Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. The study was conducted from November 2004 to December 2005.
RESULTS: 588 patients were enrolled and 446 (76\%) completed the study. Improvement in PANSS total score at week 6 was significant versus placebo (-18.8) in all groups: -24.8 (p = .03), -30.9 (p {\textless} .001), and -31.3 (p {\textless} .001) for quetiapine XR 400, 600, and 800 mg, respectively, and -26.6 (p = .004) for quetiapine IR. There were also statistically significant differences in PANSS and CGI-I response rates for all active treatments versus placebo (all p {\textless} .05). The most common AEs in all quetiapine groups were somnolence and dizziness; there were no unexpected AEs with quetiapine XR. Incidence of AEs potentially related to extrapyramidal symptoms was similar to placebo.
CONCLUSION: Once-daily quetiapine XR (400-800 mg/day) was effective versus placebo in patients with acute schizophrenia. Treatment, including rapid dose escalation, was well tolerated, with a therapeutically effective dose reached by day 2.

  abstract   = {RATIONALE: There is an unmet need in the treatment of schizophrenia for effective medications with fewer adverse effects.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lurasidone, an atypical antipsychotic, for the treatment of schizophrenia.
METHODS: Patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with once-daily, fixed-dose lurasidone 40 mg (N = 50), lurasidone 120 mg (N = 49), or placebo (N = 50). The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline to day 42 (last observation carried forward) in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale derived (BPRSd) from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).
RESULTS: Mean change in BPRSd was significantly greater in patients receiving lurasidone 40 and 120 mg/day versus placebo (-9.4 and -11.0 versus -3.8; p = 0.018 and 0.004, respectively). Treatment with lurasidone 120 mg/day was superior to placebo across all secondary measures, including PANSS total (p = 0.009), PANSS positive (p = 0.005), PANSS negative (p = 0.011), and PANSS general psychopathology (p = 0.023) subscales and Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S; p = 0.001). Treatment with lurasidone 40 mg/day was superior to placebo on the PANSS positive subscale (p = 0.018) and CGI-S (p = 0.002). The most common adverse events for patients receiving lurasidone were nausea (16.2 versus 4.0 \% for placebo) and sedation (16.2 versus 10.0 \% for placebo). Minimal changes in weight, cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose levels were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, which was limited by a relatively high discontinuation rate, lurasidone provided effective treatment for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia and had minimal effects on weight and metabolic parameters.},

The primary efficacy measure was change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, analyzed using a last observation carried forward approach. Other efficacy measures included the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (secondary) and PANSS subscales (additional). There were no significant differences between the two doses of cariprazine and placebo in PANSS total score change or any other efficacy parameter after multiplicity adjustment. However, low-dose cariprazine versus placebo showed significantly greater reductions in PANSS total (P=0.033) and PANSS negative (P=0.027) scores without multiplicity adjustment. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence≥5\% and twice that in the placebo group in either cariprazine dose group) were akathisia, restlessness, tremor, back pain, and extrapyramidal disorder. In this study, the overall cariprazine treatment effect was not statistically significant, but patients treated with low-dose cariprazine showed significantly greater improvement in schizophrenia symptoms relative to placebo-treated patients. Cariprazine was generally well tolerated. Results of this study suggest that cariprazine may be effective in treating schizophrenia and future research is warranted.},

METHODS: In this 3-arm, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group study, paliperidone ER 1.5 mg was assessed to determine the lowest efficacious dose in patients (N = 201) with acute schizophrenia. Paliperidone ER 6 mg was included for assay sensitivity.
RESULTS: Patients (intent-to-treat analysis set) had a mean age of 39.4 years; 74\% were men, 43\% Asian, and 40\% black. The baseline mean (SD) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score was 92.6 (13.02) and the mean (SD) change from baseline to endpoint was: placebo group, -11.4 (20.81); paliperidone ER 1.5 mg group, -8.9 (23.31); and paliperidone ER 6 mg group, -15.7 (26.25). Differences between paliperidone groups versus placebo were not significant (paliperidone ER 1.5 mg [p = 0.582], paliperidone ER 6 mg, [p = 0.308]). Safety results of paliperidone ER 1.5 mg and placebo were comparable. The most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events (≥10\%) were: placebo group-headache (15.6\%) and psychotic disorder (14.1\%); paliperidone ER 1.5 mg group-insomnia (13.6\%); and paliperidone ER 6 mg group-headache (11.4\%), insomnia (10\%), and tremor (10\%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, paliperidone ER 1.5 mg did not demonstrate efficacy in patients with acute schizophrenia. A markedly high placebo response was noted. Assay sensitivity with the 6 mg dose was not established. Paliperidone ER 1.5 mg was generally tolerable with a safety profile comparable to placebo.},

  abstract   = {OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of asenapine 2.5 mg twice daily (bid; n=97) or 5 mg bid (n=113) versus placebo (n=101) in adults with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.
METHODS: Adults with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) schizophrenia diagnosis were randomized to asenapine 2.5 mg bid, 5 mg bid, placebo, or olanzapine 15 mg once daily. The primary objective was to test superiority of asenapine versus placebo as measured by the change from baseline to day 42 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score. The key safety objective was to evaluate weight change in asenapine versus olanzapine at day 42.
RESULTS: The primary efficacy endpoint was met; the difference in least squares mean change from baseline to day 42 in PANSS total score between asenapine 5 mg bid and placebo was -5.5 points (unadjusted 95\% CI: -10.1, -1.0; multiplicity adjusted P=0.0356). Neither asenapine 2.5 mg bid nor olanzapine 15mg were superior to placebo. Both asenapine groups demonstrated significantly less weight gain than olanzapine at day 42. Significantly higher incidences of oral hypoesthesia and dysgeusia (combined) for asenapine 2.5 mg bid (5.2\% vs 0.0\%; P=0.0217) and 5 mg bid (7.1\% vs 0.0\%; P=0.0033) were observed versus placebo. There were no significant differences between asenapine and placebo for insomnia, extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, dizziness, or combination of somnolence/sedation/hypersomnia.
CONCLUSION: This study supports previous efficacy and safety findings of asenapine; asenapine 5 mg bid is the lowest effective dose in adults with schizophrenia. Asenapine was associated with significantly less weight gain than olanzapine at day 42.},

The HBBI study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo- and active-controlled trial. Male and female patients aged 18 to 65 years who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia were randomized in a 2:2:2:2:2:1 ratio to receive 5-, 20-, 40-, or 80-mg LY2140023 monohydrate twice daily, placebo twice daily, or placebo (am) and 15 mg of olanzapine (pm) daily. Efficacy was defined as the change from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score assessed at 4 weeks. The primary analysis did not show that any of the 4 LY2140023 monohydrate doses were more efficacious than placebo as measured by the PANSS total score. Similarly, olanzapine did not significantly separate from placebo. A higher-than-anticipated treatment effect (14.6-point improvement) in the placebo group was observed on PANSS total score. LY2140023 monohydrate was generally well tolerated, although 4 patients reported the serious adverse event of convulsion. LY2140023 monohydrate-treated patients showed little change in dopamine-related adverse events and weight. The results of the HBBI study are considered to be inconclusive because LY2140023 monohydrate and the active control olanzapine did not separate from placebo in the treatment of patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia. Additional efficacy, safety, and tolerability testing are needed.},

This report examines efficacy results from three 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled studies in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Multiple doses of iloperidone were studied. Active comparators (haloperidol 15 mg/d, or risperidone 4-8 mg/d) were included to confirm trial validity. The primary protocol-defined efficacy variable in Study 1 was change from baseline to end point in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores; in Studies 2 and 3, it was change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores. Results were assessed through analysis of covariance using last observation carried forward in the intent-to-treat population. In total, 1943 patients were randomized. At least 1 iloperidone dosing group in each study demonstrated significantly better efficacy than placebo (Study 1, iloperidone 12 mg/d [P = 0.047]; Study 2, 4-8 mg/d [P = 0.012] and 10-16 mg/d [P = 0.001]; and Study 3, 20-24 mg/d [P = 0.010]). Active controls were also significantly more effective than placebo in each trial, thus validating the trials. Additional analysis in patients who received active treatment for at least 2 weeks indicated comparable efficacy score reductions at 6 weeks for patients receiving iloperidone 20 to 24 mg/d versus those receiving haloperidol or risperidone. Risk for motor-related adverse events (eg, akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms) was lower with iloperidone than with risperidone and haloperidol and was generally similar to placebo. These trials indicate that iloperidone is effective for the treatment of schizophrenia.},

The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lurasidone in patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia.
METHOD: Patients were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with a fixed dose of lurasidone 80 mg (N = 90, 75.6\% male, mean age = 39.7 years, mean baseline score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale derived from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [BPRSd] = 55.1) or placebo (N = 90, 77.8\% male, mean age = 41.9 years, mean BPRSd score = 56.1). The primary efficacy measure was the BPRSd. The study was conducted from May to December 2004.
RESULTS: At day 42, last-observation-carried-forward endpoint, treatment with lurasidone was associated with significant improvement compared to placebo on the BPRSd (least squares mean +/- SE = -8.9 +/- 1.3 vs. -4.2 +/- 1.4; p = .012), as well as on all secondary efficacy measures, including the PANSS total score (-14.1 +/- 2.1 vs. -5.5 +/- 2.2; p = .004) and the PANSS positive (-4.3 +/- 0.7 vs. -1.7 +/- 0.7; p = .006), negative (-2.9 +/- 0.5 vs. -1.3 +/- 0.5; p = .025), and general psychopathology (-7.0 +/- 1.1 vs. -2.7 +/- 1.2; p = .0061) subscales. Significant improvement was seen as early as day 3, based on BPRSd, PANSS, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness assessments. Treatment with lurasidone was generally well tolerated and was not associated with adverse changes in metabolic or electrocardiogram parameters. There were no clinically significant differences between lurasidone and placebo in objective measures of extrapyramidal symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the novel psychotropic agent lurasidone is a safe and effective treatment for patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.

  abstract   = {RATIONALE: Bifeprunox is a partial dopamine agonist with a unique receptor-binding profile and potential antipsychotic properties.
OBJECTIVES: The current study evaluated the efficacy and safety of bifeprunox in patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 589 patients were randomly assigned to once-daily treatment with bifeprunox 5, 10, or 20 mg, placebo, or risperidone 6 mg. Efficacy was assessed by changes in symptom rating scales [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and subscale scores; PANSS-derived BPRS scores; Clinical Global Impression--Severity (CGI--S) and Clinical Global Impression--Improvement (CGI--I) scores]. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), laboratory values, electrocardiograms, prolactin levels, and weight.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, bifeprunox 20 mg produced a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline to last assessment in the primary efficacy variable (PANSS total score; effect size = -0.339), as well as most secondary efficacy measures. No statistically significant differences in efficacy were seen with lower doses of bifeprunox. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) noted with bifeprunox were gastrointestinal; no clear dose-related trend in the incidence of any TEAE was observed in the bifeprunox groups. Compared to placebo, treatment with bifeprunox led to small but statistically significant decreases in weight and prolactin levels. EPS were comparable between bifeprunox and placebo. The active reference in this study, risperidone 6 mg, showed statistically significant differences from placebo for the primary efficacy parameter (effect size = -0.628) and all secondary efficacy parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that 20 mg of bifeprunox may be efficacious in improving symptoms in patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Bifeprunox appeared to be safe and well tolerated by patients in this 6-week study.},

  abstract   = {Schizophrenia is a chronic, complex and heterogeneous mental disorder, with pathological features of disrupted neuronal excitability and plasticity within limbic structures of the brain. These pathological features manifest behaviorally as positive symptoms (including hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder), negative symptoms (such as social withdrawal, apathy and emotional blunting) and other psychopathological symptoms (such as psychomotor retardation, lack of insight, poor attention and impulse control). Altered glutamate neurotransmission has for decades been linked to schizophrenia, but all commonly prescribed antipsychotics act on dopamine receptors. LY404039 is a selective agonist for metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu2/3) receptors and has shown antipsychotic potential in animal studies. With data from rodents, we provide new evidence that mGlu2/3 receptor agonists work by a distinct mechanism different from that of olanzapine. To clinically test this mechanism, an oral prodrug of LY404039 (LY2140023) was evaluated in schizophrenic patients with olanzapine as an active control in a randomized, three-armed, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Treatment with LY2140023, like treatment with olanzapine, was safe and well-tolerated; treated patients showed statistically significant improvements in both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to placebo (P {\textless} 0.001 at week 4). Notably, patients treated with LY2140023 did not differ from placebo-treated patients with respect to prolactin elevation, extrapyramidal symptoms or weight gain. These data suggest that mGlu2/3 receptor agonists have antipsychotic properties and may provide a new alternative for the treatment of schizophrenia.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Paliperidone extended-release tablet (paliperidone ER; Invega, Janssen L.P., Titusville, New Jersey) is an oral psychotropic for schizophrenia treatment.
METHODS: Efficacy and safety of once-daily paliperidone ER (6 and 12 mg) were assessed versus placebo in 444 patients with acute schizophrenia in a 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. An olanzapine (10 mg) treatment arm was included to confirm trial validity.
RESULTS: Both doses of paliperidone ER demonstrated significant improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score (p {\textless} or = .006) and certain PANSS Marder factor scores compared with placebo (p {\textless} or = .025); PANSS total score also improved in the olanzapine treatment arm. Paliperidone ER 6 mg (p {\textless} or = .008), but not 12 mg, was associated with significant improvements in personal and social performance. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) for paliperidone ER 6 mg was comparable with placebo and slightly greater with paliperidone ER 12 mg. Changes in blood glucose and lipid levels with paliperidone ER were comparable with placebo. Two patients treated with paliperidone ER experienced glucose-related AEs. Body-weight increases of 1-2 kg were observed with paliperidone ER. Although there were increases in plasma prolactin levels with paliperidone ER treatment, the incidence of prolactin-related AEs was {\textless} or =1\%.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, paliperidone ER, particularly the 6-mg dose, was effective and well tolerated, and provides a valuable new treatment option for schizophrenia.},

ITI-007 is a new molecular entity with a pharmacologic profile that combines dose-related monoamine modulation with phosphorylation of intracellular signaling proteins.
METHODS: A phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled trial was conducted at eight sites in the United States with randomization of 335 acutely psychotic adults with schizophrenia. ITI-007 (60 mg and 120 mg), placebo, and risperidone, included for assay sensitivity, were evaluated as monotherapy for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score, with secondary analyses conducted on symptom subscales.
RESULTS: ITI-007 60 mg (p = .017, effect size = .4) and risperidone (p = .013, effect size = .4) demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy superiority over placebo on the primary end point. The results of secondary analyses reflected improvements in negative and depressive symptoms by ITI-007 60 mg. ITI-007 120 mg did not separate from placebo. However, both doses of ITI-007 were well tolerated in this patient population, as evidenced by low discontinuation and adverse event rates, and were associated with a benign metabolic profile as evidenced by significantly lower levels of prolactin, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides than risperidone.
CONCLUSIONS: The mechanistically novel investigational drug ITI-007 was effective for the treatment of schizophrenia and comparable with placebo on safety measures in this trial. Secondary analyses indicated that ITI-007 improved negative and depression symptoms and might have expanded therapeutic efficacy in comparison with current antipsychotic drugs.},

This study (NCT00694707) evaluated the efficacy and safety of cariprazine in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.
METHODS: This study was a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, fixed-dose trial. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, cariprazine 1.5mg/d, cariprazine 3.0mg/d, cariprazine 4.5mg/d, or risperidone 4.0mg/d (for assay sensitivity) for 6 weeks of double-blind treatment and 2 weeks of safety follow-up. Primary and secondary efficacy parameters were change from baseline to Week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scores, respectively. Safety parameters included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, laboratory measures, and extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) scales.
RESULTS: Of 732 randomized patients, 64\% completed the study. PANSS total score improvement at Week 6 was statistically significant versus placebo for cariprazine 1.5mg/d, 3.0mg/d, and 4.5mg/d (least squares mean difference [LSMD]: -7.6, -8.8, -10.4, respectively; p{\textless}0.001; LOCF) and risperidone (-15.1, p{\textless}0.001; LOCF); significant improvement on CGI-S was demonstrated for all active treatments (p{\textless}0.05). The most frequent cariprazine AEs (≥ 5\% and at least twice the rate of the placebo group) were insomnia, extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, sedation, nausea, dizziness, and constipation. Mean changes in metabolic parameters were small and similar between groups.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the efficacy and safety of cariprazine in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.},

The present study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with the atypical antipsychotic lurasidone for patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Patients were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with lurasidone 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, or 120 mg/day, or placebo. Changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores were evaluated using mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis. Vital signs, laboratory parameters, extrapyramidal symptoms, and electrocardiogram were assessed. Treatment with lurasidone 80 mg/day resulted in significantly greater improvement in PANSS total score compared with placebo (-23.4 versus -17.0; p {\textless} 0.05) at study endpoint (MMRM); lurasidone 40 mg/day and 120 mg/day achieved clinically meaningful overall PANSS score reductions from baseline (-19.2 and -20.5), but not significant separation from placebo. Differences between all lurasidone groups and placebo for changes in laboratory parameters and electrocardiographic measures were minimal. Weight gain ≥ 7\% occurred in 8.2\% of patients receiving lurasidone and 3.2\% receiving placebo. Modest increases in prolactin (median increase, 0.7 ng/mL) and extrapyramidal symptoms were observed following treatment with lurasidone compared with placebo. Akathisia was the most commonly reported adverse event with lurasidone (17.6\%, versus 3.1\% with placebo). In this study, in which a large placebo response was observed, lurasidone 80 mg/day, but not 40 mg/day or 120 mg/day, was statistically superior to placebo in treating acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia.

Three hundred fourteen hospitalized subjects were randomized to: Vabicaserin 200 or 400 mg/day, olanzapine 15 mg/day or placebo. Central raters assessed the PANSS and CGI-S. Site raters performed the BPRS and CGI-I. Central rated PANSS Positive (PANSS-PPS) was the primary endpoint. Two hundred eighty-nine subjects were included in the mITT efficacy analysis. Vabicaserin was well tolerated with no major safety concerns. Olanzapine, but not vabicaserin, caused weight gain. Vabicaserin 200 mg/day and olanzapine demonstrated significant improvement at week 6 vs. placebo on PANSS-PSS. A non-significant decrease vs. placebo was observed for 400 mg/day. Both vabicaserin groups demonstrated significant improvement over baseline on PANSS Negative while placebo worsened. Vabicaserin 200 mg/day and olanzapine demonstrated significantly greater improvement over placebo on PANSS Total whereas 400 mg/day showed a trend toward improvement. There was no significant improvement vs. placebo for either vabicaserin group on site-rated BPRS. Vabicaserin 200 mg/day and olanzapine demonstrated significant improvement vs. placebo on CGI-I and CGI-S but not 400 mg/day vabicaserin.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of asenapine in Asian patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.
METHODS: In this prospective, double-blind study, patients in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were randomized (1:1:1) to asenapine 5 mg twice daily (bid), 10 mg bid or placebo for 6 weeks after a 3- to 7-day washout/screening period. The primary endpoint was the mean change in the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) total score from baseline to day 42/treatment end.
RESULTS: Of the 532 participants randomized, 530 received treatment. The primary endpoint was significantly greater with asenapine 5 and 10 mg bid than with placebo (-12.24 and -14.17 vs. -0.95; p {\textless} 0.0001). The results of secondary endpoints including PANSS negative subscale scores and PANSS responders at the end of treatment supported the results of the primary endpoint. There were no significant differences in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events reported with asenapine 5 and 10 mg bid and placebo (84.6, 80.7, and 81.6 \%). There was a mean (± standard deviation) change in weight of -1.76 ± 2.45 kg for placebo, +0.42 ± 2.65 kg for asenapine 5 mg bid, and +0.81 ± 2.89 kg for asenapine 10 mg bid group.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Paliperidone extended-release tablet (paliperidone ER) is an investigational oral psychotropic developed for schizophrenia treatment. It utilizes OROS technology to provide a unique pharmacokinetic profile, eliminating the need for titration and potentially leading to improved tolerability. Furthermore, paliperidone undergoes limited hepatic metabolism.
METHODS: The efficacy and safety of once-daily paliperidone ER (6 mg, 9 mg and 12 mg) were assessed versus placebo in 628 patients with acute schizophrenia in a 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study.
RESULTS: All doses of paliperidone ER demonstrated significant improvement in PANSS score, all PANSS Marder factor scores (p{\textless}0.001) and personal and social functioning versus placebo (p{\textless}0.001). The PANSS total score also improved significantly in the olanzapine treatment arm. Significantly higher percentages of paliperidone ER patients demonstrated a {\textgreater} or =30\% reduction in PANSS total score versus placebo (p{\textless}0.001). The incidence of movement disorder-related AEs and rating scales measurements were similar to placebo for the paliperidone ER 6 mg group and higher in the 9 mg and 12 mg groups. In the paliperidone ER groups there were no reports of glucose-related AEs or clinically relevant changes in plasma lipid levels and changes in mean bodyweight{\textless}1 kg.
CONCLUSION: In this study, all doses of paliperidone ER were effective in significantly improving the symptoms of schizophrenia and personal and social functioning and were generally well tolerated. Paliperidone ER offers a distinctive treatment profile and may provide a valuable new treatment option for patients with schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of the atypical antipsychotic agent lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia.
METHODS: In this phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of fixed-dose lurasidone 20 mg/day (n = 71), lurasidone 40 mg/day (n = 67), lurasidone 80 mg/day (n = 71), haloperidol 10 mg/day (n = 72, included to test for assay sensitivity), or placebo (n = 72). Efficacy was assessed using the brief psychiatric rating scale, positive and negative syndrome scale, and clinical global impression-severity. Safety assessments included incidence of adverse events and clinical laboratory measures.
RESULTS: Numerical improvement was observed from baseline to week 6 (last observation carried forward) on all efficacy measures in all treatment groups; however, no statistically significant differences were noted between any lurasidone group and placebo, or between haloperidol and placebo. The most common adverse events in lurasidone-treated patients, with an incidence of at least 10\% (dose groups combined) and greater than placebo, were sedation (15.3\%), dyspepsia (13.4\%), nausea (13.4\%), akathisia (12.4\%), and vomiting (10.5\%); for haloperidol, the most common adverse events (incidence ⩾ 10\% and greater than placebo) were extrapyramidal disorder (20.8\%), sedation (19.4\%), akathisia (19.4\%), dystonia (15.3\%), insomnia (13.9\%), and somnolence (12.5\%). Lurasidone was associated with minimal changes in weight, metabolic parameters, and prolactin levels.
CONCLUSIONS: None of the lurasidone groups separated from placebo in this clinical study of patients with acute schizophrenia. In addition, haloperidol, which was included for assay sensitivity, did not separate from placebo, resulting in a failed study. Possible reasons for the lack of assay sensitivity in this study include the use of multiple active treatment arms and the relatively large placebo response. Consistent with other studies, lurasidone was generally safe and well tolerated, with minimal effects on weight or metabolic parameters.},

METHOD: A randomized, 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. Subjects with a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score {\textgreater}or= 60, score {\textgreater}or= 4 on {\textgreater}or= 2 PANSS items (hostility, excitement, tension, uncooperativeness, poor impulse control), and Young Mania Rating Scale and/or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 21-item version scores {\textgreater}or= 16 were eligible. Subjects received higher-dose (12 mg/d) or lower-dose (6 mg/d) paliperidone ER. Dose adjustments by 3-mg increments were allowed until day 15. The study was conducted from October 2006 through February 2008.
RESULTS: A total of 316 subjects were randomly assigned to paliperidone ER lower dose (n = 109), higher dose (n = 100), or placebo (n = 107). Mean +/- SD modal dose in lower- and higher-dose groups: 5.7 +/- 0.9 and 11.6 +/- 1.0 mg/d, respectively. Mean +/- SE PANSS total score (primary outcome) improved significantly with higher-dose paliperidone ER versus placebo (-32.4 +/- 2.1 versus -24.1 +/- 2.1; P = .003). Change with lower-dose paliperidone ER (-27.7 +/- 2.1) was not significantly different from placebo (P = .187). No new safety issues were identified; common adverse events were headache (placebo: 16.8\%; paliperidone ER: lower dose, 13.9\%, higher dose, 13.3\%) and tremor (3.7\%, 12.0\%, 11.2\%, respectively). Mean prolactin and weight changes were greater with active treatment than placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher-dose paliperidone ER was effective and well tolerated in patients with acute schizoaffective disorder. These findings and those from a companion study constitute the first registration program for antipsychotic treatment in schizoaffective disorder.

METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted between May 2013 and June 2014, hospitalized patients with acute schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with lurasidone 20 mg/d (n = 101), lurasidone 80 mg/d (n = 199), or placebo (n = 112). Nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/d (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] score decrease {\textless} 20\%) at 2 weeks were re-randomized to lurasidone 80 mg/d or 160 mg/d for the remaining 4 weeks of the study. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 6 in PANSS total score.
RESULTS: In nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/d (n = 95), dose increase to 160 mg/d at week 2 significantly reduced PANSS total score at week 6 study endpoint compared with continuing 80 mg/d (-16.6 vs -8.9; P {\textless} .05 [effect size = 0.52]). While a comparable magnitude of improvement was observed in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score from week 2 to week 6 endpoint for lurasidone 160 mg/d versus 80 mg/d (-1.0 vs -0.6; effect size = 0.44), the difference was not statistically significant (P = .052). Patients receiving lurasidone 20 mg/d did not demonstrate significant improvement compared with placebo at week 6 in PANSS total (-17.6 vs -14.5; P = .26) or CGI-S (-0.93 vs -0.73; P = .17) scores. Few dose-related adverse effects associated with lurasidone were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients with schizophrenia demonstrating nonresponse to 2 weeks of treatment with lurasidone 80 mg/d, dose increase to 160 mg/d resulted in significant symptom improvement compared with continuing lurasidone 80 mg/d. Lurasidone 20 mg/d was not associated with significant improvement in psychotic symptoms in adult patients with schizophrenia.

METHOD: Participants, who were recently admitted inpatients with schizophrenia with an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with 40 mg of lurasidone, 120 mg of lurasidone, 15 mg of olanzapine (included to test for assay sensitivity), or placebo, dosed once daily. Efficacy was evaluated using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of the change from baseline to week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score (as the primary efficacy measure) and Clinical Global Impressions severity (CGI-S) score (as the key secondary efficacy measure).
RESULTS: Treatment with both doses of lurasidone or with olanzapine was associated with significantly greater improvement at week 6 on PANSS total score, PANSS positive and negative subscale scores, and CGI-S score compared with placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in mean PANSS total or CGI-S change scores for the lurasidone groups compared with the olanzapine group. With responders defined as those with an improvement of at least 20\% on the PANSS, endpoint responder rates were significant compared with placebo for olanzapine only. The incidence of akathisia was higher with 120 mg of lurasidone (22.9\%) than with 40 mg of lurasidone (11.8\%), olanzapine (7.4\%), or placebo (0.9\%). The proportion of patients experiencing ≥ 7\% weight gain was 5.9\% for the lurasidone groups combined, 34.4\% for the olanzapine group, and 7.0\% for the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: Lurasidone was an effective treatment for patients with acute schizophrenia. Safety assessments indicated a higher frequency of adverse events associated with 120 mg/day of lurasidone compared with 40 mg/day.},

  abstract   = {OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to demonstrate efficacy of once-daily extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) versus placebo in patients with acute schizophrenia.
METHODS: In this 6-week, randomized, double-blind study (5077IL/0041) patients were randomized to receive quetiapine XR (300, 600, or 800 mg/day), quetiapine fumarate immediate release (quetiapine IR) [300 or 600 mg/day], or placebo. Primary endpoint was change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Day 42. Secondary variables included PANSS response rate at Day 42 ({\textgreater}/=30\% decrease in PANSS total score from baseline) and Clinical Global Impressions Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) ratings. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) reporting and laboratory measures.
RESULTS: Of 532 patients randomized, 222 (41.7\%) completed the study. Improvements in PANSS total scores from baseline to Day 42 across treatment groups were: quetiapine XR 300 mg/day -5.01, 600 mg/day -13.01 and 800 mg/day -11.17, quetiapine IR 300 mg/day -9.42 and 600 mg/day -6.97, and placebo -5.19; the difference in change was statistically significant only for quetiapine XR 600 mg/day (p = 0.033). There were no statistically significant differences between active treatment groups and placebo for PANSS response rates. Several post hoc analyses were conducted to explain the study efficacy outcome but these were inconclusive. Quetiapine XR was generally well tolerated with the majority of AEs being mild or moderate in intensity and no unexpected AEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Superior efficacy of quetiapine XR versus placebo in patients with schizophrenia was demonstrated for quetiapine XR 600 mg/day. The safety and tolerability profile of quetiapine XR was similar to that of quetiapine IR.},

  abstract   = {Antipsychotics are effective in treating schizophrenia but may lead to a higher cardiovascular risk due to QTc prolongation. Besides drugs, genetic and clinical factors may contribute to QTc prolongation. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of candidate genes known for QTc prolongation and their interaction with common antipsychotics. Thus, 199 patients were genotyped for nine polymorphisms in KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, LOC10537879, LOC101927066, NOS1AP and NUBPL. QTc interval duration was measured before treatment and weekly for 5 weeks while being treated with risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, amisulpride, aripiprazole and haloperidol in monotherapy. Antipsychotics used in this study showed a different potential to affect the QTc interval. We found no association between KCNH2, KCNQ1, LOC10537879, LOC101927066, NOS1AP and NUBPL polymorphisms and QTc duration at baseline and during antipsychotic treatment. Mixed general models showed a significant overall influence of SCN5A (H558R) on QTc duration but no significant interaction with antipsychotic treatment. Our results do not provide evidence for an involvement of candidate genes for QTc duration in the pathophysiology of QTc prolongation by antipsychotics during short-term treatment. Further association studies are needed to confirm our findings. With a better understanding of these interactions the cardiovascular risk of patients may be decreased.},

  abstract   = {Background
Metabolic syndrome is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with schizophrenia, with a prevalence rate double that of nonpsychiatric populations. Given the amount of evidence suggesting a link between atypical antipsychotic medications and metabolic syndrome, several agencies have recommended regular clinical monitoring of weight, symptoms of hyperglycemia, and glucose in chronically medicated patients with schizophrenia.

Objectives
To summarize the current literature on atypical antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia, outline some of the molecular mechanisms behind this syndrome, identify demographic and disease-related risk factors, and describe cost-effective methods for surveillance.

Discussion
The differential prevalence of metabolic syndrome associated with various atypical antipsychotic medications has been evidenced across numerous studies, with higher effects seen for certain antipsychotic medications on weight gain, waist circumference, fasting triglyceride level, and glucose levels. Given the association of these symptoms, all atypical antipsychotic medications currently include a warning about the risk of hyperglycemia and diabetes, as well as suggestions for regular monitoring. Despite this, very little data are available to support adherence to these monitoring recommendations. Lack of awareness and resources, diffusion of responsibility, policy implementation, and organizational structure have all been implicated.

Conclusion
The treatment of schizophrenia involves a balance in terms of risks and benefits. Failing to treat because of risk for complications from metabolic syndrome may place the patient at a higher risk for more serious health outcomes. Supporting programs aimed at increasing monitoring of simple laboratory and clinical measures associated with metabolic syndrome may decrease important risk factors, improve patients' quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs.},

  abstract   = {OBJECTIVE: The authors review the mechanisms and establish the risk of torsade de pointes and sudden death with antipsychotic drugs. METHOD: They present a review of original concepts, the distinction between familial and drug-induced cases of torsade de pointes, and the recognition of the role of noncardiac drugs in torsade de pointes and sudden death. They review the evidence linking QTc interval prolongation, potassium channels, and torsade de pointes from both the long QT syndrome and drugs. They examine the risk for torsade de pointes from antipsychotic drugs and estimate the frequency of sudden death on the basis of epidemiological data in normal and schizophrenic populations. RESULTS: All drugs that cause torsade de pointes prolong the QTc interval and bind to the potassium rectifier channel, but the relationships are not precise. Prediction of torsade de pointes and sudden death can be improved by examining dose dependency, the percent of QTc intervals higher than 500 msec, and the risk of drug-drug interactions. Although sudden unexpected death occurs almost twice as often in populations treated with antipsychotics as in normal populations, there are still only 10–15 such events in 10,000 person-years of observation. CONCLUSIONS: Although pimozide, sertindole, droperidol, and haloperidol have been documented to cause torsade de pointes and sudden death, the most marked risk is with thioridazine. There is no association with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. Ziprasidone does prolong the QT interval, but there is no evidence to suggest that this leads to torsade de pointes or sudden death. Only widespread use will prove if ziprasidone is entirely safe. To date, all antipsychotic drugs have the potential for serious adverse events. Balancing these risks with the positive effects of treatment poses a challenge for psychiatry.},

SCD in individuals receiving antipsychotics has an incidence of approximately 15 cases per 10 000 years of drug exposure but the exact association with TdP remains unknown because the diagnosis of TdP is uncertain.

  abstract = {Sudden cardiac death is among the most common causes of cardiovascular death in developed countries. The majority of sudden cardiac deaths are caused by acute ventricular arrhythmia following repolarization disturbances. An important risk factor for repolarization disturbances is use of QT prolonging drugs, probably partly explained by gene-drug interactions. In this review, we will summarize QT interval physiology, known risk factors for QT prolongation, including drugs and the contribution of pharmacogenetics. The long QT syndrome can be congenital or acquired. The congenital long QT syndrome is caused by mutations in ion channel subunits or regulatory protein coding genes and is a rare monogenic disorder with a mendelian pattern of inheritance. Apart from that, several common genetic variants that are associated with QT interval duration have been identified. Acquired QT prolongation is more prevalent than the congenital form. Several risk factors have been identified with use of QT prolonging drugs as the most frequent cause. Most drugs that prolong the QT interval act by blocking hERG-encoded potassium channels, although some drugs mainly modify sodium channels. Both pharmacodynamic as well as pharmacokinetic mechanisms may be responsible for QT prolongation. Pharmacokinetic interactions often involve drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Pharmacodynamic gene-drug interactions are due to genetic variants that potentiate the QT prolonging effect of drugs. QT prolongation, often due to use of QT prolonging drugs, is a major public health issue. Recently, common genetic variants associated with QT prolongation have been identified. Few pharmacogenetic studies have been performed to establish the genetic background of acquired QT prolongation but additional studies in this newly developing field are warranted.},

  abstract   = {Since the 1960s, physicians have been aware of electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and cases of sudden death associated with the use of antipsychotic drugs in patients with schizophrenia. Explanations for such deaths have traditionally focused on drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval leading to the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes (TdP). It is now apparent that most conventional and atypical antipsychotics can cause dose-related prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc), although there are important differences in the potency of individual agents. This review discusses potential mechanisms underlying QTc prolongation and arrhythmogenesis and examines the evidence for a relationship between antipsychotic drugs and prolongation of the QTc interval. New electrophysiological and epidemiological data are presented which suggest there may not be a clear-cut cause-effect relationship between QTc prolongation and the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias for all atypical antipsychotics. For at least one of these agents (sertindole), counterbalancing mechanisms may act to reduce the risk of proarrhythmic activity arising as a result of QTc prolongation.},

  abstract   = {Background: Precision medicine is the Holy Grail of interventions that are tailored to a patient’s individual characteristics. However, conventional clinical trials are designed to find differences in averages, and interpreting these differences depends on untestable assumptions. Although only an ideal, a constant effect of treatment would facilitate individual management. A direct consequence of a constant effect is that the variance of the outcome measure would be the same in the treated and control arms. We reviewed the literature to explore the similarity of these variances as a foundation for examining whether and how often precision medicine is definitively required., 
Methods: We reviewed parallel clinical trials with numerical primary endpoints published in 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013. We collected the baseline and final standard deviations of the main outcome measure. We assessed homoscedasticity by comparing the variance of the primary endpoint between arms through the outcome variance ratio (treated to control group)., 
Results: The review provided 208 articles with enough information to conduct the analysis. One out of five studies (n = 40, 19.2\%) had statistically different variances between groups, implying a non-constant-effect. The adjusted point estimate of the mean outcome variance ratio (treated to control group) is 0.89 (95\% CI 0.81 to 0.97)., 
Conclusions: The mean variance ratio is significantly lower than 1 and the lower variance was found more often in the intervention group than in the control group, suggesting it is more usual for treated patients to be stable. This observed reduction in variance might also imply that there could be a subgroup of less ill patients who derive no benefit from treatment. This would require further study as to whether the treatment effect outweighs the side effects as well as the economic costs. We have shown that there are ways to analyze the apparently unobservable constant effect.},

The primary analysis outcome was change in PANSS total score at week 6 last observation carried forward end point. A total of 311 subjects received paliperidone ER (n = 216) or placebo (n = 95); 52.0\% received MS/AD. The mean (SD) modal dose of paliperidone ER was 8.6 (2.5) mg/d. Greater improvement was observed with paliperidone ER than placebo on mean (SE) PANSS total scores: -20.0 (1.3) and -10.8 (1.9), respectively. Subjects with prominent manic or depressive symptoms showed greater improvement with paliperidone ER versus placebo: mean (SE) Young Mania Rating Scale (-10.6 [0.9] vs -5.7 [1.2], respectively) and 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (-10.2 [0.7] vs -6.2 [1.1], respectively). The most common adverse events with paliperidone ER were headache, akathisia, dizziness, insomnia, and dyspepsia. Paliperidone ER improved psychotic and affective symptoms both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to MS/AD. No new safety findings were observed in this population.},

  abstract   = {OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the efficacy of once-daily extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) versus placebo in adults with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.
METHODS: A 6-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. In- or out-patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were randomized to fixed-dose quetiapine XR 400, 600, or 800 mg/day, quetiapine immediate release (IR) 800 mg/day, or placebo. Primary endpoint was change from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Week 6. Other efficacy assessments included Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) of Severity (CGI-S) and of Improvement (CGI-I) ratings. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) reporting and laboratory measures.
RESULTS: 565 patients were randomized; 333 (58.9\%) completed the study. Greater numeric improvements in PANSS total score were seen for quetiapine XR (all doses) and quetiapine IR versus placebo at Week 6; the differences were not statistically significant. Secondary efficacy endpoint results were similar. There was not a high placebo response in this study, but rather an attenuation of drug effect. In general, quetiapine XR was well tolerated over 6-weeks' treatment; there were no unexpected AEs.
CONCLUSION: The efficacy of quetiapine XR (400, 600, and 800 mg/day) was not established at Week 6. Quetiapine IR, an agent with established efficacy in schizophrenia, also did not separate from placebo at endpoint. Therefore, this is considered a failed study and possible reasons for this are discussed. Quetiapine XR was generally well tolerated and its safety profile was consistent with the known profile of quetiapine.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extreme obesity is recognized to be a risk factor for heart failure. It is unclear whether overweight and lesser degrees of obesity also pose a risk.
METHODS: We investigated the relation between the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) and the incidence of heart failure among 5881 participants in the Framingham Heart Study (mean age, 55 years; 54 percent women). With the use of Cox proportional-hazards models, the body-mass index was evaluated both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable (normal, 18.5 to 24.9; overweight, 25.0 to 29.9; and obese, 30.0 or more).
RESULTS: During follow-up (mean, 14 years), heart failure developed in 496 subjects (258 women and 238 men). After adjustment for established risk factors, there was an increase in the risk of heart failure of 5 percent for men and 7 percent for women for each increment of 1 in body-mass index. As compared with subjects with a normal body-mass index, obese subjects had a doubling of the risk of heart failure. For women, the hazard ratio was 2.12 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.51 to 2.97); for men, the hazard ratio was 1.90 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.30 to 2.79). A graded increase in the risk of heart failure was observed across categories of body-mass index. The hazard ratios per increase in category were 1.46 in women (95 percent confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.72) and 1.37 in men (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.67).
CONCLUSIONS: In our large, community-based sample, increased body-mass index was associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Given the high prevalence of obesity in the United States, strategies to promote optimal body weight may reduce the population burden of heart failure.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Relapse prevention with antipsychotic drugs compared with placebo in patients with schizophrenia has not been sufficiently addressed by previous systematic reviews. We aimed to assess the association between such drugs and various outcomes in patients with schizophrenia to resolve controversial issues.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register for reports published before Nov 11, 2008; and PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for those before June 8, 2011. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and searched the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews. Randomised trials of patients with schizophrenia continued on or withdrawn from any antipsychotic drug regimen after stabilisation were eligible. Our primary outcome was relapse between 7 and 12 months. We also examined safety and various functional outcomes. We used the random effects model and verified results for the primary outcome with a fixed effects model. Heterogeneity was investigated with subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
FINDINGS: We identified 116 suitable reports from 65 trials, with data for 6493 patients. Antipsychotic drugs significantly reduced relapse rates at 1 year (drugs 27\%vs placebo 64\%; risk ratio [RR] 0·40, 95\% CI 0·33-0·49; number needed to treat to benefit [NNTB] 3, 95\% CI 2-3). Fewer patients given antipsychotic drugs than placebo were readmitted (10\%vs 26\%; RR 0·38, 95\% CI 0·27-0·55; NNTB 5, 4-9), but less than a third of relapsed patients had to be admitted. Limited evidence suggested better quality of life (standardised mean difference -0·62, 95\% CI -1·15 to -0·09) and fewer aggressive acts (2\%vs 12\%; RR 0·27, 95\% CI 0·15-0·52; NNTB 11, 6-100) with antipsychotic drugs than with placebo. Employment data were scarce and too few deaths were reported to allow significant differences to be identified. More patients given antipsychotic drugs than placebo gained weight (10\%vs 6\%; RR 2·07, 95\% CI 2·31-3·25), had movement disorders (16\%vs 9\%; 1·55, 1·25-1·93), and experienced sedation (13\%vs 9\%; 1·50, 1·22-1·84). Substantial heterogeneity in size of effect was recorded. In subgroup analyses, number of episodes, whether patients were in remission, abrupt or gradual withdrawal of treatment, length of stability before trial entry, first-generation or second-generation drugs, and allocation concealment method did not significantly affect relapse risk. Depot preparations reduced relapse (RR 0·31, 95\% CI 0·21-0·41) more than did oral drugs (0·46, 0·37-0·57; p=0·03); depot haloperidol (RR 0·14, 95\% CI 0·04-0·55) and fluphenazine (0·23, 0·14-0·39) had the greatest effects. The effects of antipsychotic drugs were greater in two unblinded trials (0·26, 0·17-0·39) than in most blinded studies (0·42, 0·35-0·51; p= 0·03). In a meta-regression, the difference between drug and placebo decreased with study length.
INTERPRETATION: Maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs benefits patients with schizophrenia. The advantages of these drugs must be weighed against their side-effects. Future studies should focus on outcomes of social participation and clarify the long-term morbidity and mortality of these drugs.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To assess the validity of the 1990 US weight guidelines for women that support a substantial gain in weight at approximately 35 years of age and recommend a range of body mass index (BMI) (defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) from 21 to 27 kg/m2, in terms of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in women. DESIGN--Prospective cohort study. SETTING--Female registered nurses in the United States. PARTICIPANTS--A total of 115,818 women aged 30 to 55 years in 1976 and without a history of previous CHD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Incidence of CHD defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD. RESULTS--During 14 years of follow-up, 1292 cases of CHD were ascertained. After controlling for age, smoking, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, and parental history of CHD and using as a reference women with a BMI of less than 21 kg/m2, relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for CHD were 1.19 (0.97 to 1.44) for a BMI of 21 to 22.9 kg/m2, 1.46 (1.20 to 1.77) for a BMI of 23 to 24.9 kg/m2, 2.06 (1.72 to 2.48) for a BMI of 25 to 28.9 kg/m2, and 3.56 (2.96 to 4.29) for a BMI of 29 kg/m2 or more. Women who gained weight from 18 years of age were compared with those with stable weight (+/- 5 kg) in analyses that controlled for the same variables as well as BMI at 18 years of age. The RRs and CIs were 1.25 (1.01 to 1.55) for a 5- to 7.9-kg gain, 1.64 (1.33 to 2.04) for an 8- to 10.9-kg gain, 1.92 (1.61 to 2.29) for an 11- to 19-kg gain, and 2.65 (2.17 to 3.22) for a gain of 20 kg or more. Among women with the BMI range of 18 to 25 kg/m2, weight gain after 18 years of age remained a strong predictor of CHD risk. CONCLUSIONS--Higher levels of body weight within the "normal" range, as well as modest weight gains after 18 years of age, appear to increase risks of CHD in middle-aged women. These data provide evidence that current US weight guidelines may be falsely reassuring to the large proportion of women older than 35 years who are within the current guidelines but have potentially avoidable risks of CHD.},

Important risk factors in this are smoking, alcohol misuse, excessive weight gain and diabetes. Weight gain also reinforces service users' negative views of themselves and is a factor in poor adherence with treatment. Monitoring of relevant physical health risk factors is frequently inadequate, as is provision of interventions to modify these. These guidelines review issues surrounding monitoring of physical health risk factors and make recommendations about an appropriate approach. Overweight and obesity, partly driven by antipsychotic drug treatment, are important factors contributing to the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in people with schizophrenia. There have been clinical trials of many interventions for people experiencing weight gain when taking antipsychotic medications but there is a lack of clear consensus regarding which may be appropriate in usual clinical practice. These guidelines review these trials and make recommendations regarding appropriate interventions. Interventions for smoking and alcohol misuse are reviewed, but more briefly as these are similar to those recommended for the general population. The management of impaired fasting glycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance ('pre-diabetes'), diabetes and other cardiovascular risks, such as dyslipidaemia, are also reviewed with respect to other currently available guidelines.These guidelines were compiled following a consensus meeting of experts involved in various aspects of these problems. They reviewed key areas of evidence and their clinical implications. Wider issues relating to primary care/secondary care interfaces are discussed but cannot be resolved within guidelines such as these.},
